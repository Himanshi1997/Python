While working to manipulate recycle bin, you would require winshell module.
However, while running the script I met with an error : : "" ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'win32con' ""

In order to get it processed sucessfully,  an extra module named pywin32 has to be involved other than winshell.

just run the following command in you cmd:

** python install pywin32 **    (without astresic)

However after running this command, an error showing "" Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement <from versions pywin32 : > 

No matching distribution found for pywin32 "" exits, it could be due to incompatible versions of python and pywin32.

Solution is to check the versions accordingly and try to reinstall the compatible one.

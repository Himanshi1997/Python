HEY!
Hope you are doing well with python!


WELL here I come with the mini code for sending sms/mms or calling through python.
In this mini project following modules will be used:

1. VIRTUAL ENV
   -Don't panic in case Virtual Env is a new term for you. You may refer my VIRTUAL_ENV file in python repository for the same.
    
2. TWILIO
   -Twilio is a SMS web API, we will connect our python to this API for sending messages. You may choose other API also.
    
Before proceeding, create your free account on Twilio : https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio.(in case if you are opting twilio)
Also, generate your phone number to test your API provided by twilio(discussed further).


STEP:1
________
________

CREATE  a VIRTUAL environment for your project first.
It is a good habit to create one for any project.

One your terminal or cmd and run following command:-------------->

$ virtualenv sendsms                      // this would create a repository in C drive named sendsms
$ path/sendsms/Scripts/activate.bat

STEP:2
_______
_______

Install the twilio module.--------------------------------------->


(sendsms)$ pip install twilio


STEP:3
_______
_______

Till it is installing, open your python editor and write the following code:------------------------------------->


from twilio.rest import Client

// enter your Account ID and Auth Token, provided by twilio when you create an account.Go to settings in your twilio acc,and 
   choose General
client = Client("ACc**************************************","4c**************************************")

// Enter your_verified_no as the no you entered while signing up.
// Enter the provided_no by twilio.
// Enter an intended message.
client.messages.create(to ="you_verified_no",
                      from_ = "provided_test_no",
                      body = "Hello Python here!")
Save you python file.
In case an error occurs showing no such module named "twilio', just ignore it.
Paste the python file in the repository you created sendsms.


STEP:4
______
______

Open the terminal/cmd, continue from where you left it.
Set the path of your python file existing in your virtual env.
Press Enter

And you will recieve a message on your verified phn no.!

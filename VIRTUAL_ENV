A virtual environment is a tool used to keep dependencies required by different projects by creating seprate isolated python virtual 
environment for them.

Following is the code to initialise Virtual Environment.

Open your terminal/cmd:

$ pip install virtualenv

//create virtualenv

$ virtualenv *my_name*

A repository will be created named "my_name"

//activate the virtual env

$ path/Scripts/activate.bat

IN path, provide the path of your created virtualenv with name "my_name" in C drive.

Now you may perform your suitable modulation like installing library etc in the virtualenv which won't affect your local system.

//Deactivate the env

(my_name)$ deativate

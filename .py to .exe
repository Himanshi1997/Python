This isn't simple as it seems.
You might have tried to change the extension of .py file to .exe file, but didn't find the anticipated output?

So you are on write track. From here I will guide you to achieve the required output.

On command prompt run the following queries:-

1. Run following command
    
    "python --version" (without inverted commas)
    
   to get the current version of intsalled python in your device.

2. If you get the version displayed, then you are on right path else if an error occured, then pl install python again.

3. Now run 

    "pip --version" 
    
   to ensure the installation of pip,if you get an error, install pip.
   
4. Now run 

    "pip install pyinstaller",  
    
   this module named pyinstaller would help you to change your py file to exe file.


5. Once it has get installed, run the following command:

    pyinstaller --onefile <file path>       # <--onefile> is optional in case you need on single file
    
    for eg: 
    
    pyinstaller --onefile C:/users/admin/desktop/py_module.py
    
 6. This .py file would then be converted to .exe file in C:/users/admin/dist
